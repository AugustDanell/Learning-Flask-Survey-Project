# [Learning Flask] Survey Project
This is a project with the tag "Learning Flask" meaning it is simply a beginning project with aims to widen the scope that is web development using Python specifically. The project is trivial, all it is is a form in which a user can input their happiness for the day and an average happiness index is calculated as well as the maximum and minimum happiness values for each employer. Further extending the project the idea is then that there will be a webpage dedicated to calculate statistics throughout the time period. We have a fictional company called "Bok-August" which is a bookstore, the title can be seen in the top left corner. An employer of this company can then go into the survey page and input their daily happiness. The idea is then that the stats page will plot this out and we can see over time the overall happiness of our employers.
